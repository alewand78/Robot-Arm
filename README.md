# Robot-Arm
## Goal
We will make a robot arm that can lift a plate from a surface. It will move it under a sink or running water. Once the plate has been rinsed off the arm will dump the water and set the plate in either the sink or on a nearby surface.
## Materials
1x Plate,
1x Arduino,
1x Switch,
3x Servos,
1x Battery Pack,
1x Bread Board,
Acrylic, 3D printed parts, Screws, Spacers, Wires.
## Schedule
